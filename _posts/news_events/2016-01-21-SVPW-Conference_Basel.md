Why do states sometimes use informal institutions instead of formal organizations to govern global policy issues? Extant research on the forms of institutionalization in global governance focuses on formal modes of cooperation, such as intergovernmental organizations and
treaties. Formal rules, however, do not exhaust the institutional variety of international cooperation. They are often inadequate, if not entirely misleading, descriptions of the game that actors play in world politics. Recent work has started to examine informal governance
as a mode of international cooperation. Informal governance refers to unwritten (and often vaguely specified) rules, shared expectations, and norms that are not enshrined in formally constituted organizations and which modify or substitute legally binding rules. It includes informal practices within formal IGOs, informal institutions, and a broad array of Networks constituted by state and non-state actors. This project examines the factors that lead states
to choose between formal intergovernmental organizations, informal intergovernmental organizations, and transnational public-private governance initiatives to structure their interactions and govern global problems. We highlight the political dimensions of informal governance and argue that distributional conflict and power asymmetries are critical for the selection and design of informal institutions. States and transnational actors use informal institutions as a means to project power and bias outcomes toward their particularistic interests. Using a new dataset on formal and informal international cooperation, we test hypotheses derived from this argument as well as functionalist explanations. We find that the choice of institutional informality is shaped by power as well as functionalist dynamics with power-related variables having larger substantive effects on the probability of observing informal institutions.
